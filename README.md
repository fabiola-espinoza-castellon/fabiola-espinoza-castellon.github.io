# About me
I hold a PhD student in data science from Université Paris-Saclay & CEA-List. During my PhD, I focused on two aspects of federated learning models while dealing with heterogeneous data. I first worked on the effectiveness of models, meaning if they are accurate on the intended goal. I then proposed defenses against backdoor attacks while still using heterogeneous data. I was advised by Cédric Gouy-Pailler and Aurélien Mayoue.
